How to get the secure_virtual_hosting example locally operational

  If we'd like to test the secure_virtual_hosting example as is, 
  we'll need to make some adjustments to our system to, first we edit /etc/hosts
  adding the two domain names, change the top of the /etc/hosts file to

  127.0.0.1  localhost   nodecookbook.com   davidmarkclements.com

  (Don't forget to remove these after, otherwise you wont be able to navigate to those sites!)

  Restart your network with sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart (or restart system if running Windows)
  
  Open Firefox 
    (instructions are only for Firefox, should be able to achieve the same in IE but this wont work in Chrome, 
      although your mileage may vary)
  Go to Edit -> Preferences
  Click the Advanced tab
  Click View Certificates
  Go to the Authorities tab
  Click Import
  Navigate to this howto directory, and import the CA.pem file
  
  Now Firefox will recognise the specially made the Node Cookbook Root CA and the examples will work.
  
  Simply start server.js and go to https://nodecookbook.com:8080  and https://davidmarkclements.com:8080
  for warning-free secure virtual hosting results.
  
  Obviously for production this will never do, we need a vendor trusted Certificate Authority, and that means
  purchasing a certificate and replacing the domains with ones we control.
  

How to take the secure_virtual_hosting example live
  We would need to replace the domains (davidmarkclements.com and nodecookbook.com) with ones we control
  and configure the DNS settings to point at the IP address of a live server running secure_virtual_hosting/server.js
